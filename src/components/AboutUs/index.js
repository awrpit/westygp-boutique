                    like in shops, but you have seen an image of a garment you

                I am really happy with my dress. The whole process was very
                smooth and I enjoyed it a lot. Shreya and the team helped me to
                come up with a dress that is exactly what I was looking for (and
                within my budget)!

                So quick and the dress is lovely. Unfortunately, I didn’t end up
                wearing it as intended (total wash out weather wise) so I am
                going to have it as a reception dress when we get to do that!

                The team was phenomenal to work with. Lots of different ideas
                and quick to make adjustments, even working on opposite time
                zones. My pieces are absolutely perfect and I can’t wait to wear
                them. As a plus size, I was worried because not everyone knows
                how to fit/dress a bigger body. The team did an exquisite job.
                Would recommend it for fashion lovers of all shapes and sizes.
